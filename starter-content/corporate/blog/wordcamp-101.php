                <p class="">What is WordCamp? It’s a place for WordPress enthusiasts to meet, greet, and speak about everything WordPress. Many in attendance play a much more active role in the WordPress community, guiding and assisting WordPress users all around the world through community-based Support Forums, and documentation from contributors on everything from installing WordPress to creating plugins.</p>
                <h3>The WordPress Community</h3>
                <p class="">At any given time, an announcement seeking speaker applications as well as organizing teams to attend WordCamp goes out to WordPress enthusiasts in North America, similar announcements can be seen in Africa, and Europe. As community members from around the world prepare for attendance, it’s at this time you may be wondering “What can you expect from attending a WordCamp?”.</p>
                <p class="">It’s about everything WordPress. From developers and designers to first-time bloggers, WordCamp is a place to meet, collaborate, and discuss everything WordPress. The focus of the event is on using and developing for WordPress and all are welcome. First organized by Matt Mullenweg in 2006, and held in San Francisco, events continue to grow in attendance with local WordPress communities organizing over 796 WordCamp events in 65 countries spread across 6 continents. What stands out as astonishing is how the event organizers, speakers, and attendees are all volunteers from local WordPress communities. It is these local communities that together make the WordPress community as a whole, and that is the highlight of this post.</p>
